This example demonstrates a common error in F# related to immutability.  The `let` keyword declares immutable bindings, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are initialized. This example attempts to reassign a value to `x`, which leads to a compiler error. The solution shows how to use `mutable` to create a mutable variable, although this is generally discouraged unless strictly needed.
